<h2>History of Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
<p>
<i>1994- HÃ¥kon Wium Lie proposed the idea of CSS</i>. 1996- The first version of CSS was invented. 
1998- CSS 2 was released and work on CSS 3 began. CSS 3 was very different from the other versions,

known as modules.

<p>
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language 
used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML.CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share 
formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the 
pages that share the file and its formatting.

<h1 style="color:#FD7000"> CSS cursor</h1>
<p>It is used to define the type of mouse cursor when the mouse pointer is on the element.
 It allows us to specify the cursor type, which will be displayed to the user. 
When a user hovers on the link, then by default, the cursor transforms into the hand from a pointer.

<h1 style="color:#FD7000"> CSS Display</h1>
<p>CSS display is the most important property of CSS which is used to control the layout of the element. 
It specifies how the element is displayed.
Every element has a default display value according to its nature.
Every element on the web page is a rectangular box and the CSS property defines the behavior of that rectangular box.

Buttons help us to create user interaction and event processing. 
They are one of the widely used elements of web pages

<h1 style="color:#FD7000"> CSS Float</h1>
<p>The CSS float property is a positioning property. 
It is used to push an element to the left or right, allowing other element to wrap around it.
It is generally used with images and layouts.
To understand its purpose and origin, let's take a look to its print display. 
In the print display, image is set into the page such that text wraps around it as needed.
